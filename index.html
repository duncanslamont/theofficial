	It is within the barren wasteland of the Coronavirus quarantine that I write to you, my new followers. This is the first of many kimonos. A kimono is a traditional japanese garment, and just like the japanese wear their garments with pride and grace, you will wear the words I publish with a similar swagger. I begin this journey with you summarizing the past few days of my life, in as much accuracy and honesty that I can manage.<br>
	Let’s start on Friday. Friday I had a “recitation” for an economics class I have already taken, I did not virtually attend. I did not attend in spirit either. I have been to one economics recitation and it was extremely boring and horrible, and such a waste of a Friday morning that I refuse to ever think of going again. Anyways, Friday I do believe that I got absolutely nothing accomplished. Saturday was a blur. I woke at maybe 11am, and fell asleep at 9:30pm. Usually people including myself have a waking time of approximately 17 hours, but I only managed 10 and a half. As I’m writing this I am trying to recount a brilliant idea I had for a chapter of a book I intend to write called Mind of a Monkey. The chapter was about something to do with internal thought, I think it had something to do with how other people think? Perhaps it was about my Christian roomate who had the dilemma about having sex before marriage. I don’t remember, but I intend to. From what I remember about this idea, it was an idea I had occasionally, but never really thought it through. Hopefully I remember before I finish writing this book I haven’t begun.<br>
	Today is Sunday. I read a few chapters of a book, called The Wind Up Bird Chronicles. It’s enjoyable so far but I’m not ready to recommend it to anyone yet. I only provide my readers with the highest of quality literature. I have done basically nothing but read those chapters and write this blog, so I guess I’ve accomplished a few things. That thing I forgot is still bothering me though. Anyways, wear these words with honor my readers. Until tomorrow, Love.
