	I think I remembered my idea! The idea is that these days, so many people have glasses, but a few hundred years ago no one had glasses because of the lack of technology and medical information. So what must monkeys see? Or perhaps the idea was that people who are nearsighted in vision are also nearsighted in life. I have no idea how I remembered this, but it is genius, and there will be a chapter when I do write Mind of a Monkey. You might wonder, why wait? Quarantine is the perfect time to write a book. You’re right, however I’m writing a different book. Something a bit more complicated, which takes time to build. However I am writing down ideas for the book. It’s about how monkeys must have an internal thought process, or at least wandering around that idea for a few hundred pages. If you have ideas, please send them to thewalrusauce@gmail.com . I will respond! <br>
	Anyways, to less self indulgent content. Today I did nothing yet again. Today I didn’t even read, though I may read later. I had three classes that I did virtually attend, but the first two I slept the entire time, and the third I was web browsing the entire time. I don’t super regret either decision, but I think I should have played a whole lot less video games today. Anyways after I write this blog I intend to finish a chapter of the novel I’m writing and send it to my writing teacher. His advice is kind of weird and slightly useless but it’s at least a first glance as to what I need.<br>
	To sum up this lackluster entry, I will speak about my birthday, which is theoretically tomorrow but it is past midnight so it is today. I honestly feel like birthdays are depressing, because it’s not like I accomplished anything, I just got born. Who the fuck cares when I was born, other than my age increasing. It makes me sad because I know I never get as much love as a lot of other people, but no love was earned in the first place, and it’s just this horrible situation where I’m losing a game I was forced to play but didn’t want to play. Sorry for the personal ramble. Wear these with honor. Until tomorrow, Love. <br>

	It is within the barren wasteland of the Coronavirus quarantine that I write to you, my new followers. This is the first of many kimonos. A kimono is a traditional japanese garment, and just like the japanese wear their garments with pride and grace, you will wear the words I publish with a similar swagger. I begin this journey with you summarizing the past few days of my life, in as much accuracy and honesty that I can manage.<br>
	Let’s start on Friday. Friday I had a “recitation” for an economics class I have already taken, I did not virtually attend. I did not attend in spirit either. I have been to one economics recitation and it was extremely boring and horrible, and such a waste of a Friday morning that I refuse to ever think of going again. Anyways, Friday I do believe that I got absolutely nothing accomplished. Saturday was a blur. I woke at maybe 11am, and fell asleep at 9:30pm. Usually people including myself have a waking time of approximately 17 hours, but I only managed 10 and a half. As I’m writing this I am trying to recount a brilliant idea I had for a chapter of a book I intend to write called Mind of a Monkey. The chapter was about something to do with internal thought, I think it had something to do with how other people think? Perhaps it was about my Christian roomate who had the dilemma about having sex before marriage. I don’t remember, but I intend to. From what I remember about this idea, it was an idea I had occasionally, but never really thought it through. Hopefully I remember before I finish writing this book I haven’t begun.<br>
	Today is Sunday. I read a few chapters of a book, called The Wind Up Bird Chronicles. It’s enjoyable so far but I’m not ready to recommend it to anyone yet. I only provide my readers with the highest of quality literature. I have done basically nothing but read those chapters and write this blog, so I guess I’ve accomplished a few things. That thing I forgot is still bothering me though. Anyways, wear these words with honor my readers. Until tomorrow, Love.<br>
