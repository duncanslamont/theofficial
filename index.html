	Entry 8 8/1/20 <br>
	As I am writing this, I would say I am fairly tipsy. I just  drank two beers on an empty stomach. Also, drank is the wrong word. Drank violently would be a better phrase to describe the action that was me ingesting the substance. I did this in an attempt to better my editing process for a story I’m writing. I’m trying to decide whether or not to go on vacation with my family tomorrow. It would be for at least a week, and I would be forced to share a room with my brother, who I don’t hate, but I certainly don’t want to spend every waking moment in a room with either my brother or my dad. Nothing against the two I just really need alone time at this point in my life. So much reading and writing and thinking that I couldn’t bear to be distracted (which I certainly would be) by external forces. I’m thinking of staying, but then the company would be even worse, my other part of my family. Though the company would be worse, I’m certain that my ability to be alone would be much better. I am just now remembering a dream in which I was being tested for something at a somewhat glass house, and I seem to think that this dream is very old, but how could I randomly remember an old dream. This sort of dejavu confuses me and I don’t like it. Anyways, I’ve mostly stopped recording my dreams, though last night I had a somewhat memorable one with someone from a youtube channel I frequent, but that’s not really important. I’m working on a story about a communist robot, and I hope to maybe get it published(if my father likes it enough, he may send it to a publisher.) But we’ll see how my luck turns out(I’ll keep you posted.) Anyways, sayonara. <3   <br>

	Hey guys, sorry I haven’t really posted in a while. I was kind of distracted, by what is confusing to me. I think I was addicted, in some sorts, to watching the world go by me, being passive and sluggish. Not reading, simply watching things on the computer, and browsing the social media which I have now deleted from my phone, hopefully permanently. I have decided that I will fervently read for a large part of each day, at least for the foreseeable future. This is because before I can start to get competent in my own writing, I wish to view the best works, in hopes I get a broader view of the subject as a whole. <br>
	Many of my novel and screenplay ideas have shattered before my eyes as I read these books, but a few stand strong. Just you wait, I am roughly a third of the way through my screenplay, though just a rough draft, and everyone who has read it laughed out loud. Perhaps I can adapt it into a novel? This might be hard, as the screenplay was based off of some characters who I have spent a good time developing, especially their voice. So this voice would not transfer when audio is not present, but obviously people read books in their heads so it’s obviously not ruined, just not maximized(though depending on the actors, it might not be maximized in film either). <br>
	Anyways, I have thoughts of perhaps trying to do stand up when I get back to NYC, though I don’t really have an in, and also there is a virus raging on. I could ask my kind-of friend who is apparently a stand up, though I never thought she was that funny. Time will tell, but these voices I have spent time developing need to be shared with the world, and I think they can occasionally be so good they warrant a laugh without good content. And good content isn’t all that hard to come by. But we’ll see. Not a good time to start being a stand up.<br>
	Anyways these are just some of my thoughts, a new kimono for a while. Been writing a journal, as well as a dream journal. It’s fun. No way I remember my dream last night if I didn’t write it down. Alright, adios. Email me at thewalrusauce@gmail.com if you wish! <br>


	Entry 6 5/21/20 <br>
	Hello all, I haven’t been active on this site as is evident from my lack of posting, but I was looking at my bookmarks, and this caught my eye. I read a few of the entries and somehow found myself inspired by myself! Impossible! Anyways, reading all about how I was excited about my novel will hopefully spark something in me, as I haven’t worked on the novel in a long time, but I really should be because it’s easy, and it’s something tangible: I can’t just make a movie right now, but I can certainly write a book. So, that is my new task. I fear that I will need to scrap most of what I have now, but maybe not. Every now and then I inspire myself, and I have many ideas of the world that I think would make wonderful chapters. Anyways. Until tomorrow, Love.<br>

	
	Entry 5 4/3/20 <br>
	Today was an uneventful day, so I will keep this entry short. I continue to be unproductive, but I am at the very least being fairly creative. I thought of a plot for a story based on the words “strawberry castle”. It’s quite a fun story I hope to write in the near future, after my other projects. I have one novel I’m in the midst of writing, and one novella I have many ideas about. Anyways. Until tomorrow, Love.<br>

	Entry 4 4/2/20 <br>
	Yesterday I did not make an entry, as you all know. I did not make an entry, because I usually make my entry at around midnight, to sum up a day as the day has officially ended. I fell asleep last night at around 9:30, so I was not able to make an entry. Sorry. Though there weren’t many interesting things that happened to me yesterday. Actually there was one thing: I showed my writing teacher (who is actually a poet, not a fiction writer) a chapter of the novel I’m working on, and he liked it alot, though the said he would be doing me a disservice by giving me harsh criticisms as he is a poet not a fiction writer, and he said he could get in contact with his friend who is a fiction writer and he could look at my work. I am hoping this person can get me into the world of fiction, and potentially help further my career, though these are all just hopes. <br>
	His criticisms were mostly content based, instead of writing style based, and I’m not sure if that’s a good or bad thing. I want my writing style to be as perfect as it can, as I have complete confidence in the interestingness of the plot. Hopefully this new guy can help me out with that, though I have received no emails regarding him in the 30 or so hours since I talked with the poet. <br>
	I’m starting to realise that I need a few days break in between writing chapters, not one hundred percent sure why, but maybe it’s my creative juices getting drained. I do have to admit though, I was really in love with the chapter I wrote, well not with the structure of it, but just with some of the descriptions I made, and again not all of them, just some of them. I just think that I’m going in the right direction.<br>
	Anyways, not a super interesting entry, but I’m still deciding what I want this to be, either a sort of diary, or a weird mind dump of my thoughts. We’ll see. Maybe I’ll look back at this entry in 20 years and see what I was like when I was 20. Kind of depressing to think about it, but I’m sure I’ll have figured something out by then… I hope. Good luck 40 year old me! ;) Until tomorrow, Love. <br>

	Entry 3 3/31/20<br>
	Today I turned twenty. I don’t care all that much, but I did hear somewhere that by age twenty two you have lived half of your life proportionally, because time seems to go slower when you’re a kid, so doing the math or whatever somehow I’m close to the end of the first half of my life.This doesn’t really concern me all that much. I have no doubt that I will do what I want to do in the next few years, and that’s as far as I wish to mentally venture. <br>
	Last night after I wrote the entry, I got quite a lot done on the novel; I wrote most of a critical chapter, and I do think that it came out quite lovely. I’m still not sure who to trust with reading my work, as it is both extremely rough, yet also quite personal, and mushy. Most people who like to read that kind of stuff don’t have a lot of very critical things to say. They mostly say “Aww that was so cute” or shit like that. No real substance. Not that my writing is all lovey dovey shit, it’s just a complicated piece that involves love as everyone’s life does.<br>
	Maybe if I get an email from a reader, I will share a chapter by email to you. Seeing as I have not advertised this, and topdick.page isn’t a very common URL, I don’t expect much of anything, but the internet is full of lots of weird people like myself. Anyways, boring birthdays (not that not being in quarantine would make it any more exciting) and just as unproductive as ever. <br>
	To end this entry, I thought I would explore an idea I had while eating a cake my grandma made for me, and then gave to me safely at a distance. I was eating this macaroni and cheese my step mom had made, and it was really good, but I felt bad because I took a lot when there wasn’t a lot left, but really any less would just be a tease. Anyways, I proportioned it exactly so that I would have room for a slice of cake after, but I forgot that my dad had made broccoli, so we would “get a vegetable in us.” This threw off everything, and I couldn’t finish my favorite slice of cake that I always look forward to. This made me think. What is the ideal play in this situation? Obviously the best thing you can do is have full information, but it’s impossible. Let me know your thoughts, and until tomorrow, Love.<br>
	

	Entry 2 3/30/20<br>
	I think I remembered my idea! The idea is that these days, so many people have glasses, but a few hundred years ago no one had glasses because of the lack of technology and medical information. So what must monkeys see? Or perhaps the idea was that people who are nearsighted in vision are also nearsighted in life. I have no idea how I remembered this, but it is genius, and there will be a chapter when I do write Mind of a Monkey. You might wonder, why wait? Quarantine is the perfect time to write a book. You’re right, however I’m writing a different book. Something a bit more complicated, which takes time to build. However I am writing down ideas for the book. It’s about how monkeys must have an internal thought process, or at least wandering around that idea for a few hundred pages. If you have ideas, please send them to thewalrusauce@gmail.com . I will respond! <br>
	Anyways, to less self indulgent content. Today I did nothing yet again. Today I didn’t even read, though I may read later. I had three classes that I did virtually attend, but the first two I slept the entire time, and the third I was web browsing the entire time. I don’t super regret either decision, but I think I should have played a whole lot less video games today. Anyways after I write this blog I intend to finish a chapter of the novel I’m writing and send it to my writing teacher. His advice is kind of weird and slightly useless but it’s at least a first glance as to what I need.<br>
	To sum up this lackluster entry, I will speak about my birthday, which is theoretically tomorrow but it is past midnight so it is today. I honestly feel like birthdays are depressing, because it’s not like I accomplished anything, I just got born. Who the fuck cares when I was born, other than my age increasing. It makes me sad because I know I never get as much love as a lot of other people, but no love was earned in the first place, and it’s just this horrible situation where I’m losing a game I was forced to play but didn’t want to play. Sorry for the personal ramble. Wear these with honor. Until tomorrow, Love. <br>

	Entry 1 3/29/20:<br>
	It is within the barren wasteland of the Coronavirus quarantine that I write to you, my new followers. This is the first of many kimonos. A kimono is a traditional japanese garment, and just like the japanese wear their garments with pride and grace, you will wear the words I publish with a similar swagger. I begin this journey with you summarizing the past few days of my life, in as much accuracy and honesty that I can manage.<br>
	Let’s start on Friday. Friday I had a “recitation” for an economics class I have already taken, I did not virtually attend. I did not attend in spirit either. I have been to one economics recitation and it was extremely boring and horrible, and such a waste of a Friday morning that I refuse to ever think of going again. Anyways, Friday I do believe that I got absolutely nothing accomplished. Saturday was a blur. I woke at maybe 11am, and fell asleep at 9:30pm. Usually people including myself have a waking time of approximately 17 hours, but I only managed 10 and a half. As I’m writing this I am trying to recount a brilliant idea I had for a chapter of a book I intend to write called Mind of a Monkey. The chapter was about something to do with internal thought, I think it had something to do with how other people think? Perhaps it was about my Christian roomate who had the dilemma about having sex before marriage. I don’t remember, but I intend to. From what I remember about this idea, it was an idea I had occasionally, but never really thought it through. Hopefully I remember before I finish writing this book I haven’t begun.<br>
	Today is Sunday. I read a few chapters of a book, called The Wind Up Bird Chronicles. It’s enjoyable so far but I’m not ready to recommend it to anyone yet. I only provide my readers with the highest of quality literature. I have done basically nothing but read those chapters and write this blog, so I guess I’ve accomplished a few things. That thing I forgot is still bothering me though. Anyways, wear these words with honor my readers. Until tomorrow, Love.<br>
